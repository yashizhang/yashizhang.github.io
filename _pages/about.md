Hi! My name is Ya Shi Zhang, where "Ya Shi" is my first name (Andrew also works). I was born in Beijing, China and grew up in Vancouver, Canada. I enjoy golfing, snowboarding, traveling, playing pickleball, and practicing my pour-over technique.

I also enjoy machine learning research â€“ please see my [CV](https://yashizhang.github.io/files/YaShiZhangCV.pdf) or my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XnGGhVEAAAAJ&hl=en) for more details. I recently completed [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos) in probability and mathematical statistics at the University of Cambridge. My Part III essay (master's thesis equivalent) on sampling methods can be found [here](https://yashizhang.github.io/files/PartIIIEssay.pdf).
