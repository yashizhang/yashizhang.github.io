Hi! My name is Ya Shi Zhang, where "Ya Shi" is my first name. I was born in Beijing, China and grew up in Vancouver, Canada. I enjoy golfing, snowboarding, traveling, playing pickleball, and practicing my pour-over technique.

I also enjoy machine learning research â€“ please see my [CV](https://yashizhang.github.io/files/YaShiZhangCV.pdf) or my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XnGGhVEAAAAJ&hl=en) for more details.
